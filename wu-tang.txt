Yo a man shot dead in his back Helpless women and children on the constant attack For no reason Till the next season And we still bleeding Yo it's freezing And men burn in hell, some for squeezing No hope for a remedy, nothing to believe Moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve Forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body Late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty Having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons no provisions Deceived by the devils decisions Forced into a slave Death before dishonor for those men who were brave Shot and sent to their grave Can't

David My heart belongs to God and stay sacred Rabbi's and priests Disabled individuals The poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals Mass extermination Total annihilation Shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation Tortured and starved Innocent experiments Stripped down and carved up or gassed to death The last hour, I smelled the flowers Flashbacks of family then sent to the showers Powerless undressed Women with babies clumped tight to their chest Crying Who would've guessed dying Another life lost Count the cost Another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust   Chorus: Never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter Never again leave our sons and daughter Stripped of our culture Robbed of our name  Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames  Forced from
